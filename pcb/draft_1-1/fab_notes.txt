  actually, pdf view is looking up at chip, thus pads are mirrored on section 9.2, keep KiCAD AS_IS

*** update eletronic egg schematic and drawing annotation at bottom right to rev 1.2

How to get debug terminal?
 Arduino Serial.setup(9600); Serial.println("test");

How to do this simple task with Atmel Studio?
  Usb examples only have echo, with no clear way to insert content between the read and write operations.  Useless as a demo of the communication protocol

DAC example non-functional.  Which pin is DAC_0? PA02 as DAC0
*NO* indication of expectations: voltage only goes up to 0.24V (0.12V when looping quickly), though multimeter had a grounding issue offset. had to add delay_ms(10); to see anything recognizable on DMM
test_analog_location3 - reached 3.3V output with 4096 steps
Need to read from PA02; and tie PA03 to ID (3.3V to VREF)

Upload to target
Use Target USB at 38400 baud for messages (why isn't this terminal a feature in Atmel Studio???)

-- Pressing and release button SW0 should make LED0 on and off --
The output is triggered by TC counter

CONF_STDIO_BAUDRATE is 38400

I want to merge "Atmel Start" project with the demo so that I can control PB06 as a debug output.  Having two projects in the same "solution" has poorly explained conflicts (will only compile the second project while igrnoing the first)

trying to add a helper file/function generates build errors

Remidned of Apollo 13 "Let's look at this as a question of status: What do we have that wroks?"

there appear to be mixed generation os libraries between "Getting started" and the "Atmel Start" projects - specifically in port_set_gpio... and gpio_set_digital... naming/usage conventions

HOW TO MERGE libraries between projects?  Want to use the UART/USB described in the "Getting started" project with the KNOWN TO WORK PB06 toggling from "Atmel Start"

Have to read between the lines to determine that a .h file is needed (error messages are useless for help)

like trying to combine two south magnets, IDE fights me every step of the way...

	SercomUsart *const usart_hw = &(module->hw->USART);

	/* Check if USART has new data */
	if (!(usart_hw->INTFLAG.reg & SERCOM_USART_INTFLAG_RXC)) {
		/* Return error code */
		return STATUS_BUSY;
	}
