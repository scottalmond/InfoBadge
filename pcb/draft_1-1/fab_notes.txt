*** update schematic license and author CC BY 4.0

*** start routing by connecting 100 nF caps near pads

x ***accel: CW/CCW reverse pins on pads
  actually, pdf view is looking up at chip, thus pads are mirrored on section 9.2, keep KiCAD AS_IS

*** update eletronic egg schematic and drawing annotation at bottom right to rev 1.2

*** verify placement of eInk header with respect to cble length from opposing side of board
*** connect analog reference https://hackaday.io/project/165887-pam8301-breakout-board

How to get debug terminal?
 Arduino Serial.setup(9600); Serial.println("test");

How to do this simple task with Atmel Studio?
  Usb examples only have echo, with no clear way to insert content between the read and write operations.  Useless as a demo of the communication protocol

DAC example non-functional.  Which pin is DAC_0? PA02 as DAC0
*NO* indication of expectations: voltage only goes up to 0.24V (0.12V when looping quickly), though multimeter had a grounding issue offset. had to add delay_ms(10); to see anything recognizable on DMM
test_analog_location3 - reached 3.3V output with 4096 steps
Need to read from PA02; and tie PA03 to ID (3.3V to VREF)
